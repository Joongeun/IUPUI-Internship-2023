            "['Hey everyone, I unsub subreddit time I vaped Christmas Day. Prior I vaped day New Years Day 2015, prior I smoked pretty daily I don\\'t know, 7-10 years. Before I un-sub though, I thought right thing drop cents worked hopes benefit it, way I\\'ve benefitted encouragement people posted me. &amp;#x200B; So facts personal situation conclusions I drawn: 1 - I wanted stop vaping YEARS reason, I manage it. Conclusion: You WANT it. But WANTING isn\\'t it\\'s own. 2 - I started vaping 3mg, mg stayed time vape rigs got bigger bigger. Over 2 years though, mixing liquid I stepped nic level 3mg, 1.5mg, 0.75mg finally 0.325mg. I stayed 0.3mg level year little nicotine big challenge, I think titrating nec level helped. Conclusion: Weaning nic level gradually DOES help. 3 - I tested positive Omicron Christmas Day evening (Yep sucked). That day I vaped, 48 days ago today. Now first, think oh main thing, I\\'ll tell now, I symptomatic 3 4 days testing NEGATIVE time I vaping like maniac. I didn\\'t REMOTELY suspect I covid I tested positive shock, I think unwell days easier helped soften worst withdrawals. If know vaping going feel bad, it\\'s easier it\\'s enjoyable thing do. That said, prior I sick MANY times, including OG Covid 2020 nasty flu / bug September 2021 vaped it. So covid wasn\\'t determining factor, opinion. Conclusion: If sick unwell flu, that\\'s great time step away vape want. 4 - THIS IS THE IMPORTANT PART - **TL:DR JUST READ THIS PART** The important factor, I stress I truly believe difference, I VERY CAREFUL use \\'Q\\' word - know one. I felt like I cautiously quietly sneaking past sleeping guard-dog, VERY CAREFUL wake up. Hiding secret thought sentinel brain. Every single time I pang craving, \\'I want vape\\' feeling / thought popped head, I consciously intentionally talk / think \\'oh yeah! Cool, I\\'ll vape bit. I\\'m gonna finish real quick\\'. Pretty soon, urge pass way, \\'beast\\' stayed asleep. This isn\\'t I\\'ve seen talk I think single important factor. In fact pretty EXACT OPPOSITE advice I\\'ve seen heard subject. Maybe traditional stuff works people, working me. Every time I attempted this, I \\'Q\\' word. I\\'d set date. I\\'d use hypnosis tapes. I\\'d tell friends family. I\\'d start new healthy habits. I\\'d try usual things, psyching preparing ahead time, EVERY SINGLE TIME date rolled around, instead I order bottle juice, tell \\'well I finish bottle first\\', decide actually pretty stressful time maybe I wait bit, variation above. Each time didn\\'t plan served re-enforce narrative insurmountable thing possible, harder. My theory - try traditional approach, subtext you\\'re tellling depriving like helps somehow, will-power force don\\'t actually want do. Even DO actually want it, framing way subconscious feels like it\\'s losing tries protect makes nearly impossible. Using will-power opinion WORST way change habit behaviour. It\\'s like hanging pullup bar - you\\'re strong able hang bar long time, maybe hours. But eventually, muscles strongest man earth fatigued let go, it\\'s physics. But nicotine addiction isn\\'t matter hours, I it\\'s 30 Day MINIMUM. So nicotine longer hold metaphorical bar, bam! It it\\'s clutches belief takes hit. So instead depriving yourself, DON\\'T! If craving, tell craving \\'okay! I hear you! You win!\\' conveniently caught else. Just again. DO NOT WAKE THE SLEEPING DOG kicking road. The thing I I sure I didn\\'t tell soul earth going 30 DAYS time I vaped. You find 30 days so, cravings frequent. At day 48 frequent still, I woods, beast sleeping little deeper now... I reckon day 90 I\\'ll pretty safe 1 year - maybe okay use \\'Q\\' word. But now, I \\'the time I vaped X days ago\\'. I haven\\'t given up, I don\\'t feel deprived. The cravings appear time time. But do, I know say... Try it. Give go. It\\'s way easier DON\\'T GIVE ANYTHING UP! It 48 days I vaped I haven\\'t anything. In wise words Syrio Forel, \"**There god Death, thing Death**: \\'Not today. \\' \" TL/DR: Imagine you\\'re playing mental Judo / craving instead willpower, \\'yeah sure ok! I\\'ll vape little bit I finish this\\' time craving. Don\\'t use Q word.', 'TL;DR: story getting addicted, I\\'m now, looking tips help ease quitting Hi everyone, found subreddit wanted share story maybe tips.

I started vaping December 2019 Christmas party actually, I loved good felt I said \"eff it, let\\'s buy own\". Quickly I found highest nic possible I live 50 nic, thing I knew I going pod day easy 50 nic wasn\\'t getting headrush like place. &amp;#x200B; So big mistake, I kept chasing headrushing, higher higher, went away completely. That\\'s I realized good thing I start tapering down. Otherwise I healthy individual, I hit gym 5 days week eat healthy I can. I don\\'t drink quit smoking weed months ago, I think let rationalize vaping head \"you right, 1 vice ok\". But I didn\\'t like high nic getting little \"good feelings\" giving point. &amp;#x200B; Fast forward 2 months later I gone 50 nic/1+ pod day, 35/1 pod day, 35 1 pod 2-2.5 days, 20/1 pod 2-2.5 days. And I 20 mark maybe 2 weeks I figured I stop fine. But I don\\'t know psychological I caved couldn\\'t. So I went 10 nic now, continue weaning (I think lowest I 3 nic). &amp;#x200B; I feel little defeated I wasn\\'t able cold turkey 20 nic, honestly I\\'m looking bit support, I don\\'t life right now. I started vaping begin massive stressors life helped mind feel free bit. My game plan 10 nic 1 month, 6 1 month, 3 1 month, quit start mixing 3 nic half half 0 nic essentially 1.5 nic month. Does sound like solid plan well? &amp;#x200B; And thing makes tough right now, I genuinely love feeling I I vape. It feels like brain cloud, that\\'s best way I describe it. But I know it\\'s good me, brain says \"it\\'s terrible you, it\\'s better drinking daily smoking actual cigarettes\". And I honestly don\\'t know long term effects vaping are, it\\'s knowing makes want lean quitting eventually weaning off. &amp;#x200B; I guess thought/question be. If I 3mg nic eventually vaping often, terrible I vaped infrequently day I like feeling, recommend point away entirely? &amp;#x200B; Again, thanks, I need support right now, I don\\'t talk it.

Then I started bringing school, lunch. Then I started multiple periods day, eventually got point I bathroom use EVERY period day. At point, I full-on addicted, nonstop, going pod day, spending $20 4 days, wasting hard earned money minimum wage jobs. I knew I addicted, didn\\'t care honestly. I enjoying myself.

But light end tunnel. I heavy-ish nicotine user. I typically vape 3ml 30mg juice day. I tried weening times, I lose resolve I felt like. Eventually I got sick making excuses putting I went cold turkey. Day 1: As long ‘impulse cravings’, actually pretty easy. If experience similar mine, you’ll little groggy, surprised function it. This extremely motivating hold motivation dear life. Because days 2-4 suck ass. Days 2-4: The second wake day 2, immediately start questioning resolve. This quitting sheer willpower absolutely necessary. You feel like got hit truck. You WILL extremely irritable. You INSANE cravings. Days 3 4 similar. BUT, it’s ok. Because it’s 3 days. It pass, worst over. If day 5, hardest fought. Days 5-7: This start feeling like somewhat normal human again. You start getting irritable mental fluidity returns bit. You start seeing light end tunnel. Your cravings pretty bad, overcome new motivation find. You hardest part, time long time feel like normal human having use nicotine. It’s easier here. 1 Week - 1 Month: Your cravings slowly fade period time. Every day little easier. You\\'ll start noticing time in-between impulse cravings. You proud yourself. There caveat period time, though. You admit yourself, battle getting easier, NOT over. It easy feel like you\\'ve won, feeling come complacency. You need forefront mind reasons quitting are. It extremely important avoid triggers period time. 1 Month+: In experience, month things easier. You\\'ll start hours time thinking nicotine. You\\'ll truly feel like again. You\\'ll start feeling content social settings, little voice head tells sneak hits gone. The battle over, though. Nicotine avoid rest life. You resolve. If talk quit relapsed later on, tell took time totally restart progress. You sure doesn\\'t happen you. **Some things helped quit:** Find resolve: It absolutely important solid personal reasons quitting. If don\\'t, soon gets hard you\\'ll likely up. Having resolve fall lifesaver tough moments. Two biggest resolves 1) I absolutely hated feeling reliant vape feel like normal person. I hated moments I lose vape scrambling find fear having it. I needed end. 2) I math maintaining vaping habit cost course 10 years, scared shit me. I don\\'t lot money, number I saw calculator sick. Identify triggers: If you\\'re like me, you\\'re probably thinking \"I don\\'t triggers, I like vaping.\" I thought exact thing, I realized I wrong. You realize triggers start quitting. As soon realize them, need avoid possible. My biggest triggers drinking, waking (I hit vape excessively morning brain working. Often times I got bed.) Driving surprising trigger me. The biggest people smoking vaping. I absolutely avoid situation. Find triggers, aware them, avoid can. Stay Busy: This simple, it\\'s super important. If you\\'re laying whilst quitting, chances you\\'re gonna start thinking vaping. Stay busy. Build new habits. For personally, I found starting gym extremely helpful. Do absolutely distract yourself. Play video games, walk, learn instrument you\\'ve wanted to, clean bedroom. Just brain occupied quitting easier. Throw away: Don\\'t vapes, juices, memorabilia, it. When decide quit, throw away grand fashion. Smash baseball bat, run car, flush toilet. Not getting rid help avoid relapse, it\\'s symbolic. This new you. You aren\\'t quitting, don\\'t vape. You longer vapes. Utalize mindset. I means expert, hopefully helpful. Please feel free ask questions I\\'ll happy share experience.

While I cut chain vaping good year (mostly thanks working long shifts old retail job), July, moved parents house apartment- honestly, got chain vaping day day. I vape desk puffed constantly home. So couple weeks ago, I COVID scare- people apartment building tested positive (most asymptomatic, thank God), somewhat scared wanting quit vaping more.

Well, there's story. Anyways, look, want drop Nicotine completely, Zyn/other nic pouches you. But you're like concerned breathing energy levels nic itself, I'd it.

Approximately 10+ years nicotine addiction, going 2 Elfbars week I quit. **Here rough timeline:** Woke Sunday decision quit absolutely cold turkey. This night friends casino, vaping like madman.

I began JUUL partying favour, switched STLTH device 6-7 months (February 2019). The STLTH device I smoking consisted 2ml pods 50mg nicotine ml I finishing approximately pod day half so. Pretty quickly, developed chain smoking vaping - approx 10am 12-1am day. This July 2020, I picked recreational marijuana smoking (dealing boredom COVID) led daily smoking (from bongs) - day, night vaping. I began notice decreased appetite obviously time vaping August 2020, I noticed lot stomach chest pain eating eventually induced vomiting. After reaching doctors, I notified acid reflux I suffering - induced constant vaping marijuana. I given prescription fix acid reflux told I quit vaping smoking sorts - I DID NOT do. Throughout time, I dealt mental stresses - mainly relationship based stressing out. This combined acid reflux bringing quality life. From August 2020 December 2020, I barely eating acid reflux ignite I kept vaping smoking marijuana acid reflux prescription work. However, smoking marijuana thing got eat vaping kept emotions stables. Eventually, I felt drained relationship stresses acid reflux - I ended having blown anxiety meltdown lot vomiting felt induced emotions smoking/reflux. This meltdown bad brought emergency room I told I absolutely needed quit smoking better. This December 11th, day I smoked vape bong. I originally tried quit cold turkey. Within hours, anxiety levels high - like ER - led attempt quit Nicotine patches. I originally started December 12th 14mg (step2) patches. I wore 24 hours 3 days - felt fatigue, bit anxious okay. On 3rd night, December 15th, I felt uncontrollable sadness - I stop crying I didn’t know why. I tried sleep off, woke day feeling way. I reached local detox centre (not professionals, addicts help) phone, suggested dosage nicotine low suggested reaching doctor medication help mood. I immediately went pharmacy got 21mg patches (step1), headed local walk doctor (I’m 23 year old student, living away home, walk doctors access.) I mention day 3 point, urge vomiting gone like doctors said stop longer smoking. The doctor didn’t tell much, looked pupils, gave prescription “something help calm down”. When filling prescription, pharmacists notified anti depressant - completely set unstable mood. I immediately went home continued feel lows, I took anti depressants. About hour after, I felt urge vomit (who knows point). The lows anxiety continued night fatigue anymore I wide awake night, tiny bit sleep I got I felt haunted nightmares. The morning, I called family came got me, reached family doctor day got talk registered nurse office acknowledged feelings completely normal going withdrawals I feeling acting local emergency speak psychological department. I anti depressant day I unsure scared throw again. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE IF YOURE STILL KEEPING UP. At hospital, nurses doctors ER looked eye said “you’re depressed sweetie” - I pushed talk mental health area got crisis nurse. When speaking him, lot life style habits discussed (relationship stresses, family stresses) maybe I going withdrawals maybe going on. I I shown symptoms psychological disorders, family felt need “looked at” - bit confusing case. Leaving hospital hours, I given mental health worker psychiatrist - I assessed December 28th. I given anti psychotic “sleep aid”, small dose 5mg (I looked given anti depressants, completely normal suffering insomnia). Anyways, this, I truly believed I crazy - bipolar, schizophrenia, etc. I felt low. That night, I took anti psychotic, I terrorized bad nightmares again, waking couple hours sweats. At point, I don’t think body brain knew happening I felt completely empty. Waking day, feeling dreaded on. I got touch family doctor directly finally, mentioned probably bad withdrawals mixed stresses, assessment send psychiatrist I eventually talk to. She suggested actually patches HIGH giving anxiety, wearing night insomnia plus night terrors. For anti psychotic anti depressants, suggested trying speaking psychiatrist- especially making ill anyway. Instead, suggested vitamin D supplements daily. This December 17th. Starting December 18th, I went 14mg patches limited time usually 10am -8 9pm. Additionally, I taking acid reflux medication vitamin D morning. My sleeping stable, fatigue couple hours patch taken off, appetite raising, mood low stable increased day. Over days, I started keeping patch day. I think I rushed this, high moods kept motivated (wrong idea). Today, December 28th, I didn’t wear patch haven’t night 9pm. I extremely irritable, sad anxious day, randomly crying evening, took toll. I popped nicorette gum relied support system I’m starting feel relief. NOW: My question vapers quit: suffer similar situation? I know story different feelings withdrawals? I believe so, mood increased decrease nicotine slow time. I think break tonight might’ve rushing quitting again. I wanted ask suffered - anti depressants process? (I want to). I believe acid reflux decreasing quality life, quitting marijuana vaping lead giant collapse. I appreciate ANY insight opinions remember I’m 23 I trying beat addiction, I don’t need negativity.

And I'm prone worrying, thats I'm vaping often, I'm gonna worry I vaping much. And extend pity party. We're anxious quitting, we're anxious everything. No wonder can't deal quitting. Because sole reason we're wanting quit badly we're damn worried it's you. There's anxiety quitting. As it's Herculean undertaking. I think nicotine dropped reather easily. But want date, day touch nicotine. And creates anxiety. And anxiety finds perfect home anxious person. It's nicotine.... We're addicted crack cocaine opiods. Relax. We've sold wrong idea nicotine. And it's time change thinking. We realize nicotine can't THAT bad, can't live nicotine coming system waking minute, starting soon wake up. I mean it's THAT good begin with. Nicotine average, feels like... nothing. How hit feel like youve chain vaping long dont know stopped past hour? It feels like NOTHING. So average feels like noting hard quit? Unless tool disassociate. Yes. You want disassociate reality having constant interface outside object stimulates 3-4 senses once: taste, sight, smell, complex sensations vapor going lungs, dopamine kick nicotine. You start constantly subconsciously detached reality can't deal with, slightly. Cigarette companies directly built products mechanism. It consuming tobacco simpler convenient uniform. It great feat marketing product design. Now then, vaping products built smoker mind. Because vaping, invented originally method quit smoking. So it's designed feed impulses smoker - rapid chaining inhale action certain dissociative quality. Vaping product essentially, ciggarettes are. Not terms health effects terms functions registers subconscious level. This nicotine replacement therapy exists works some. It breaks subconscious association drug (nicotine) action getting drug. And brain realizes drug task, realizes drug, it's affects, consumption action completely different things. It breaks illusion exposes smoking fidget action. Because well, you're smoking anything, getting nicotine (say nicotine patch). But doesn't work most. Most preferred form nicotine, vape, cigs, pipe, chewing tobacco, etc. Some adopt cessation form primary. I've heard getting addicted nicotine gum quitting smoking. Even patch sort interface, touch. You constantly feel it's it's you. There's thing free nicotine. You can't consume nicotine thin air. There's interface it. So then, natural question urgency?Why quitters wish nicotine again? Surely smoker want occasional smoker. That guy craves cigarettes drinking whisky. The cool smoker. Unlike pathologically addicted smoker/vaper are, totally uncool (because obviously, constant slavery chemical uncool. You know it, I know it). Why dont wanna cool smoker? I think tried fell it. We've written doesn't work. We want stop smokig bad, wanna stop right now. And god!! smoked life time. It's completely okay wanna touch again. But creates unnecessary anxiety quitting. Goodbyes hard. My opinion occasional smoker you've broken psychological links. You occasional nicotine. going hookah place, bumming ciggarette friend you're clubbing. But time won't it's mental tick anymore. And different experience together. Or disillusioned smoking then, successful deprogramming attempt cigs/vape, want touch it. Who wouldn't hate chains feet they've broken free.

This long, I apologize, think benefit another\\'s\\' story read. **Background** I started experimenting friends\\' vapes early February 2016, senior year high school. For started recently, 2016 vaping far common people owned them. It noted small easily concealable devices nearly available popular today. So, I began partake, options friends\\' large mods sub-ohm tanks. As I sure know (if time) things absolutely obnoxious. While fun, tasted great, contained negligible nicotine (3-6mg cases), experiences vapes unknowingly thrust worse habit. For proceeding 4.5 years, I vape constantly. In lecture? Go bathroom 15 minutes fix...hell, certain point I use class zero hit. In restaurant? Same thing. Out public device dies/runs juice? Begin frantic hunt willing let share theirs couple pity rips. As I type sounds ridiculous got point, life better half decade. If you\\'re curious story, continue, I section I quit that\\'s you\\'re looking for. **How I Got Here** *The Beginning* As I said above, start February 2016...with old box mods. I want reiterate obnoxious things were. Properly dubbed \"cloud machines\" friends I, believe. If 3 things normal sized living room, smoke alarms frequently set off. One thing I find hilarious time life way peers I felt things. Specifically, parties sort gathering going on, god forbid host said vaping, leave blatantly disobey. We took offense saw attack us, instead was; sensible person didn\\'t want house absolutely smoked out. Back story...I continued living friends\\' vapes weekends 2 months. The month I ridiculous buzzes, end night laying bed sick stomach combination heavily sweetened juices nicotine content, despite low was. I proceeded \"buy\" I own. I quotes I split cost friend, like certain wanted pay price buy own...but hooked nic knew wanted more. As expect, splitting vape trading weekends lasted 4 weeks. After that, upgraded massively bought higher end devices, recently turned 18 actually store choose specific tank, mod, juice, etc. wanted. This I like beginning end. Around \\\\~June 2016 now, I graduated friends...and started spiral control. Over summer leading leaving school, money work proceed continuously upgrade higher wattage, larger tanks, batteries, etc. roughly basis. Getting new vape like getting new video game kid, got new you\\'d friends wanted try \"best\" thing. Then once, went school upgrading halted vaping intensified. Living time gave plenty time vape day I wasn\\'t class rec. Then Thanksgiving break bad happened. We heard device stupid (juul) looked like flash drive, crazy levels nicotine. But, I personally seen interest looking, sounded like people worse positions nicotine I was...boy I wrong. That fall break, friend (who I originally split mod vape with) came juul. He abandoned mod vape months ago, apparently, addicted new juul. I said I never, us, man brought juul knew exactly happen. *The Real Addiction Begins* Fast forward summer 2017, months prior juul gone I seen time everywhere. This dumb ass little stick small finger, pods available gas station (no gross fingers filling tanks!), buzzes intense, least. I ended getting new job indoors summer, I knew I couldn\\'t bring large vape pocket expect away it. So I turn? I bought shiny new juul. Even writing this, I wish I jump time smack this. It started pretty simple, tank vape work juul work. At pack pods lasted weeks, I started I car (that\\'s I kept it), I brought inside house, I stopped going WITHOUT it. By end summer, I stopped box mod entirely relied solely highly concentrated salt nicotine body accustomed to. This persisted entire sophomore year, wasn\\'t summer 2018 I realized money I spent. In year juul, I buying 2-4 packs week (depending week) I bought 6-7 juuls total losing/breaking constant use. *Going Through The Motions* At point I realized problem I created looked refillable devices. I continued 50mg salt nicotine, tried half dozen different kinds refillables year. Now, I going motions. The vapes didn\\'t taste good anymore, I got buzzed, I running money...fast. All reasons I starting gone, I position quit. This continued roughly May 2019, worse juuls start up. *The Disposable Era* Summer 2019 saw emergence disposables. At looked like juuls weird wraps like 300-400 puffs, I remember I buy 3/$20. As people voiced sub before, disposables false sense \"I\\'m nicotine addict I quit whenever, I don\\'t actually device,\" alluring. These missing life original box vapes, flavor incredible.

Still thinking now, I going hang brother tonight, he’ll definitely offer smoke I’ll definitely it. Oh well, brother tonight. Social distancing that.', \"About 4 years ago(July 2015) I got vaping got hooked instantly. Expensive box mod, sub-ohm, 12nic 1.2% Ejuice, nine. For people Juul, 12nic relatively high nicotine content Ejuices. Anyways, I vaping way 5 months quit cold turkey. I quit soon I started wanting hit vape immediately waking up. I knew bad sign. I sold box mod day, threw juice coils, it. It easy quit, I don't remember having withdrawal symptoms. A little 3 years later(October 2018) I got hooked Juul. It started occasional thing I quickly went Juuling pod day. I went pod day 9 months, unsuccessful attempts quit. July 2019 I decided I quitting good. I decided Nicorette try. I thought save money didn't. The pods gas station $25 I buying close packs week 9 months I Juuling. The Nicorette $9 10 piece pack lasted days. So 4 days I spending $20 gum saving $5 compared Juul pods. On that, gum wasn't working. I went 4 days Nicorette. On 5th day I thought vaping days recalled I quit cold turkey. At point I considering help quit. So I went bought small vape mod decided try taper way nicotine hopes eventually vaping 0nic juices. I debated kind vape buy ended buying mod DOES NOT WORK WITH NIC SALTS. In opinion best decision I made. Nic salts secretly addictive buying mod I forced use Ejuices. I bought mod, 6nic 0.6% juice, 3nic 0.3% juice hopes switching 3nic juice I began taper nic. I like point size, low vapor production, overall portability JUUL add increased risk addiction. The mod I bought instantly cut times I vaping bigger JUUL, required effort fill, produced way vapor. I wasn't hitting car, I wasn't hitting walking class, I wasn't secretly hitting bars, etc. I start notice I craving nicotine much. And importantly I craving *process taking break JUUL.* I think huge factor JUUL/Vape/Cig addiction. People hooked idea taking break smoke. It's end August I happily I quit completely. Haven't vaped, JUULed, month now. I started 6nic juice didn't need 3nic juice. After weeks vaping 6nic juice I it. I didn't like process vaping entailed, I didn't bring I left house, I didn't hit constantly day like I JUUL. I realize I didn't explicit details I noticed lot people posting trying quit JUUL I wanted share story. I'd happy answer questions.\", 'Hi everyone.

I (F22) started chain vaping 18, I finished high school sports didn’t need lungs anymore. I started mods, Suorins, Juuls, disposables. Quit an… unhealthy relationship relapsed years. I I vaped 5 years then. I extreme oral fixation addiction, primary nicotine. When I quit nicotine time psychological stuff I wanted suck smokey stick. Anyways, I wanted quit real I graduated college living alone. Here’s process far: I started weaning vaping/nicotine trip family (only vaping bathroom). It didn’t like much, vacation vapes died lot easier I thought throw away start white knuckle it. As soon I got home (didn’t want irritable family) I threw vapes away downloaded Quit Vaping app. I strongly recommend it, helps lot numbers (any number motivate there). I list reasons I quit addition “reason why” app. Keep handy. Mints, mint flavored toothpicks, regular mint gum tos. Oral fixation needed helped, things help (especially altoids me). Probably best thing I recommend Pavlok shock clock. I got help wake morning (extremely deep sleeper). It shocks awake, habit control. When I vaping I “aversion” function shock I crazy vape session. Now I quit I use function I craving. It shocks 30 seconds 5 minutes I shaking thinking “Nicotine feel better.” Spoiler alert, nic actually makes feel better. It’s hard. I triggered friends vape, I got ripple I knew I cravings control. Ripple pods different activities (or claim) I going stick activities. If I want snooze, I’ll use “relax” pod. Time tell ripple, there’s nicotine I don’t fear cravings I otherwise. Take day day. Do works you. A small step backwards isn’t end world doesn’t equal relapse, mistake. Quit else. Some helps push quitting line experience quit long person / impetus around. Quitting yourself… you’re around. Some things right you, wrong you, infuriating you. I don’t care, me.

Sure minutes hours passed I remained clean, I “knew” I break sooner later I constantly fight urge, putting kind resistance exhausting. Well guess what; says true, IT GETS EASIER. And that’s it. You fight waiting out, weeks simply won’t fighting anymore. It doesn’t happen overnight, doesn’t happen suddenly, mind games eventually gradually away.

After solid run, I easily pathetic I cravings. That motivation running; knowing end run, perception different, temporary wave mind games. - Allen Carr’s book “Easyway”. My biggest drive mental freedom, I found Easyway parallel thoughts. So I picked lessons book I reference (by earmarking pages spoke me, I quickly remind I quit moments weakness). The important lesson words void I created. If little time, I suggest check Chapter 14 titled “What I giving up?” (Chapter # different depending edition). I readings addiction (Nakken’s “Addictive Personality” I reference often) I think having understanding mind good weapon battle addiction. Everyone different, find guidance inspiration makes sense you, don’t feel strong enough. - This sound silly, effective me: I’d pretend I holding Juul, bring thumb &amp; index fingers mouth, deep breath I inhaling Juul, exhale. I’d mimic hitting Juul, actual device. It’s basically breathing exercise twist. Afterwards I ask \"Ok, let\\'s actual device hand, fake hits I took real. What now, I better way?\" The possible benefit alleviating withdrawal symptoms nicotine addiction, that\\'s it. - Chugging ton water once. Not quench thirst, going body tells stop. Also I found carbonated/mineral water great mimicking throat hit vaping. - Not idle. In couple weeks, I spent lot time binging shows (comedies useful I felt absolutely miserable small chuckle meant world then) playing time-sink games time pass faster. Staying busy helpful, I didn’t feel motivated productive, I decided I completely alright that, I knew quitting nicotine best things I myself, I wanted hard part. Any activity time pass fast good me. I coma I could! - Keeping mind strongest cravings temporary. The mind games come cravings easier fight stubbornly ignore them. Don’t negotiate voice, soon start debating, lose. Simply aware thoughts away eventually usually help hang there. I told voice inside “Yeah yeah stfu, I’m vaping again” kept going. Easier said course, that’s it: You tell “stfu” going, eventually stops bothering you. - Staying away triggers. I think people it’s alcohol, me, biggest trigger coffee fruit juices. I simply stopped drinking juices (which bonus effect vastly reducing sugar intake) I slowly re-introduce coffee daily life. Nowadays I drink coffee fine cravings, I can’t recall time I thought “some smoke/vape coffee right now” - Social support. I got app called \"Quit Vaping\" forum &amp; chat feature, helpful, especially I didn’t relate battle. I highly recommend quitting subreddits support. It’s motivating going battle, makes load feel lighter. - Nicotine gum. I reserved gums weakest moments. I ended taking 20 gums total, weeks journey. - Toothpicks. I carried box toothpicks pocket, oral fixation got bad I’d chomp toothpicks. (I think reason people gain weight quitting smoking, want mouth occupied ways smoking) - Not sure helped cravings, I nicotine patches 10 weeks. They usually come program (wearing patches day x weeks, gradually lowering dose). I decided stick way through, sake discipline. Not sure conclude it, I didn’t feel different I patch, I didn’t feel different day patch. Best luck all.', 'Hey i’m currently day 24 I quit nicotine vaping. I quit previously 2 years 2019-2021.

I started medication it’s hydroxyzine (antihistamine benzo), makes tired help calm down. Other I dealing chest pains. Hence cardiology appointment I made. It’s probably I hope.

It didn\\'t help I working restaurant 2019 2021, I constantly stressed surrounded smokers/vapers. It didn\\'t help following job, I worked home I vaping CONSTANTLY. 10 days ago, I decision quit vaping. It sort spur moment decision honestly. I didn\\'t plan like that. I reflecting 2021 I wanted 2022, major theme thinking I wanted stop things hold back. I felt like I\\'ve relying lot vices gave comfort I need change. So things, I stopped vaping. For 3-4 days, vaping I think about. It sucked. I extremely irritable, volatile, pessimistic, lethargic, anxious. It like breathing getting worse, like I couldn\\'t air breath. It felt like breath missing 20% air I needed, I found agonizing panicking \"missing\" 20%. Unless I actively distract me, breathing conscious exercise. I constantly remind lot mind, I actually getting air despite I perceiving. Then holiday season ended I work week. And REALLY sucked I vaping drives work day. Plus, I intense, emotionally exhausting, stressful job. I constantly remind goals: stop letting professional life affect personal life. I tell start vaping allow work impact personal life, helped honestly stressful week stressful job. Now, it\\'s 10 days, benefits I\\'m noticing (note I stopped vaping marijuana 5 days ago, benefits well): * Breathing officially easier. I longer experience feeling able suck air. I longer feel need consciously manage breathing. It happens own, feels good. * As extension previous benefit, I way easier time playing sports working out. I regularly play tennis, takes noticeably energy. When I lift weights, I longer headaches. * I\\'m peeing A LOT less. I\\'m drinking coffee, I\\'ve actually drinking water, I\\'m going bathroom couple hours like I to. This unexpected benefit. Before, I assumed I peeing coffee. I idea nicotine affect urine output, case. * My pets healthier relaxed. Back I vaping, I read articles claiming secondhand vapor shouldn\\'t cause harm animals long open windows turn fan. This purely anecdotal, I believe claim false. I\\'m noticing major difference pets\\' behavior. They\\'ve chilled out. One dogs anxiously lick paws. She longer that. Another dog tons eye boogers tear stains. No more. After seeing changes, I honestly feel guilty. I can\\'t believe I pets shit audacity think okay. * I\\'m tune reality. Before, I got stressed, I vape feel sense relief. Now, I stressed, I start think life needs change. I feel like I different perspective job now, like I\\'m seeing job simply wasn\\'t healthy I need work finding new job changes work me, simply nicotine cope I shouldn\\'t endure. * It\\'s hard tell attributable quitting weed, I sleep feel better rested. I\\'m longer sleeping alarm. When I wake up, I stay awake feel good it. I\\'ve naturally waking earlier having easier time getting bed. I don\\'t wake feeling tight anxious day anymore. I don\\'t feel need naps anymore. I dunno. It like I\\'m getting mileage sleep. * I\\'m motivated. It\\'s weird, like layer automatic hesitation removed actions. Again, I\\'m sure quitting weed lot this, I want something, I fucking now. I don\\'t waste time agonizing spend time. I don\\'t lose interest quits. I feel good it. When I vaping, I found spending free time paralyzed dread looming workday. Like, instead actively things, I\\'d settle passive forms entertainment dull nerves time work again.

Multiple doctors asked concrete answer wanted answer visit. Here’s trouble I’m having trying calculate out: I use Orion Q device. You don’t buy pre-filled ‘pods’ whatever. You buy bottle eliquid want, fill tank needed. I refill tank it’s completely empty, burn coil, etc. I’m sure consumption rate is. If I check bank account time I bought eliquid, I *maybe sorta* super rough guesstimate long takes 3 bottles, isn’t particularly consistent time either. And THENNNN, I absolutely idea calculate nicotine content I’m consuming I’m can’t heads tails calculate it. With pods, it’s pre-measured it’s specifically labeled way semi-easily translate equivalent comparison regular cigarettes. With juices, lists mg/ml bottle (mine 25mg/30ml. Not sure exactly sure tank holds, let’s 1-3mls.) So…. Is 25mg bottle? Meaning like… I use 1ml juice day, mean end day, I consumed total 1.2mg nicotine day? Or…? (30ml divided 25mg) I feel like there’s way I’m getting 1.2mg nic/day. The reason I that, is: I vaping help quit cigarettes. Right I switched ecigs, I smoking pack half 2 packs day, roughly 15 years. The transition cigarettes vaping SURPRISINGLY easy. I initially set goal transition slowly cigarettes vaping course month (ex- week I allowed 10 cigs day, instead additional 20-30 cigs I normally smoked day, I use vape instead, slowly lower number cigs allowed day week I got zero.)

I juul, 50mg/mL. I switched 12 mg/mL freebase, I’m vaping 18-30 watts .4 ohm coil nic level perfect me. You 18 that’s enough. 24 max use freebase. 2. I sure device away myself, like different floor house. If I’m watching tv it’s reach, I’ll hit 5 min, it’s left room, I easily hour. 3. Set timers. I started setting 30 min timers, 5 min vape sesh between. I raise timer minute day. 4. Set rules yourself. Some rules: vape pooping, vaping bed, vaping 10 min straight. Keep making rules strict, sure eventually cut vaping want most. Recently I rule vape couch, I it. My rule vape outside, slowly I making vaping convenient myself. 5. After wanting up, wait long possible taking hit. 6. Find juice flavor 7. Taper nicotine. It’s hard vape commercial juice, nic levels pretty far apart other. If find shop makes house, yourself, taper small increments like 1 .5 mg/mL. 8. To quit, plan. For example, 3 month plan. Determine you’ll Increase time breaks day, you’ll decrease nic time. The length breaks important nicotine level, decrease nic, sure vape less. 9. Meditate, Remember strong, health, everything. If right thing life, okay, nicotine nicotine. Also, don’t slip way, right pick left off. Good luck, it! :)', 'I run landscaping business &amp; I’ve noticed I set easier now. I broke girlfriend &amp; stopped vaping time, total breakdown.

Sobriety doesn\\'t happen accident. You want need good reason quit reason personally meaningful you- shouldn\\'t anybody else. I don\\'t necessarily think overly righteous grandiose, like \"I want best possible role model family\" like that. In opinion, simple \"I want healthy\" \"I want financially responsible nicotine dependency huge waste money\". ***Mindfulness meditation***\\\\- practice aware cravings come. Don\\'t fight them, are. They temporary symptoms withdrawal drug. Like tide sea shore, comes goes. Even having worst craving humanly possible, gone 20 minutes. If choose vape unpleasant feeling away, temporary delay inevitable. And hey, symptoms withdrawal closely mirror hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). So so, times, brain can\\'t distinguish two. We mistakenly think need smoke actually hungry. So craving comes, try eating like piece fruit taking puff. A lot times, find actually low blood sugar.

From there, quitting matter how, why, me. For example, false beliefs I vaping held quitting truth: Belief #1: Vaping reduces stress Reality #1: Vaping actually increases stress body, short-term long-term. Nicotine central nervous system stimulant elevates blood pressure, breathing rate, sweating. All stress responses body. In actuality, feeling relief experience vaping relief stress, relief drug withdrawals, stems physical dependence drug. Belief #2: Vaping healthy alternative, compared cigarettes Reality #2: First all, false parallel. Cigarette smoking #1 cause preventable deaths worldwide. So healthy alternative compared cigarettes. It worth mentioning scientific studies examining long-term effects vaping, certainly compared vaping smoking long period time. So scientific support claim vaping damaging smoking long-term. In fact, theoretically, vaping likely produce worse health outcomes smoking terms peripheral vascular disease hypertension, owing higher nicotine content.Belief #3: Going nicotine withdrawals cold turkey nightmare Reality #3: The physical symptoms nicotine withdrawal actually mild. As previously mentioned, similar feeling mild moderate hunger. There mild people don\\'t notice nicotine cravings quit smoking/vaping. Identifying deconstructing false beliefs I holding years, helped psychological aspect quitting (the hard part). From there, easy, allowed focus physical symptoms nicotine withdrawal, extremely mild, especially compared drugs. It shocks nicotine addiction psychological easy actually quit. Once able mentally realize quitting logical decision physically won\\'t suffer, it\\'s cake walk. That\\'s I recommend giving The Easy Way cursory glance. ***N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) supplement (1200 mg)***\\\\- NAC chemical anti-inflammatory anti-oxidant properties restores glutathione levels body, liver. Historically, NAC\\'s recognized medical use treating acetaminophen overdose, recently, gained attention discovered strong effects impulse control. Specifically, reputed effective reducing nicotine cravings, research yet. Although purely anecdotal, I 100% believe helped. Whenever I particularly strong craving time cravings getting shorter I started worry sobriety jeopardy, I skipped mindfulness meditation step took 1200 mg NAC. Since takes 45+ mins bloodstream cravings 20 mins less, won\\'t kill craving dead tracks. You beat initial craving, NAC hits blood stream, work magic won\\'t craving long time (at like 4 hours experience). The great thing NAC extremely well-tolerated low toxicity effects, unlike well-known contemporary, varenicline (chantix). ***Throwing vape, juice, cartridges, away***\\\\- meaningful reason, you\\'ve cleared psychological hurdles, set quit date effective methods deploy cravings come, you\\'re ready big leap. There\\'s going back, trust me, won\\'t regret it. This fun part. You revenge vape taking control life, health, tricking you, preying insecurities personal flaws turning addict. Be creative devilish step, fun it. Throw vape body water, smash hammer, like. But salvageable. Now time craving won\\'t away multiple cravings, another, try mindful meditation. If persists, 1200 NAC trying meditate. If that\\'s working decide want vape maybe you\\'ll try quitting time, you\\'ll think heavily decision length car ride, choose turn time. If hadn\\'t thrown away everything, lost sobriety instant impulsivity reaching arm\\'s length away, long, drawn process took lot time careful consideration/deliberation. ***Buying disposable vape***\\\\- convenience store/smoke shop want vape, buy disposable one. And use session lasting hours. If meant quit heart it, puffing vape feel disappointing unsatisfying, considering fact cost sobriety. At end session, throw away/destroy vape one. And proceed methods reducing/controlling cravings. You probably won\\'t succeed 1st, 2nd time, 3rd time, 4th, 5th. But stick trying, day you\\'ll forget convenience store/smoke shop. &amp;#x200B; **Things didn\\'t help me:** ***Fear/guilt based methods*** ***Quitting else*** ***Varenicline (Chantix)*** ***Nicotine replacement therapy (patches, gum, lozenges)*** ***Slowly tapering dose*** ***Experiencing health problems vaping (as motivation quit)*** &amp;#x200B; If far, I hope found helpful I wish best quitting journey.
