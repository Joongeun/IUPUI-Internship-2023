#IUPUI Internship (2023) 

Topic and Sentiment Analysis of Redditâ€™s Vaping-Cessation Community: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10385341

Abstract:
To alleviate the teen vaping crisis, this study analyzed the "QuitVaping" subreddit. We identified posts sharing experience and/or advice using DistilBERT and investigated distinctive features in the data with topic modeling (BERTopic) and sentiment analysis (VADER) based on upvotes. We extracted 23 distinct vape-related symptoms and 17 suggested withdrawal methods, along with insightful topics. Highly upvoted posts often contained hopeful advice with positive sentiments. Our results help understand individual experiences, giving valuable insights to reduce teen vaping.
